# LangChain Studies

This repository contains pieces of information and their corresponding Python codes about LangChain functions. The purpose of this repository is to store essential information about the LangChain framework, serving as a quick guide and assisting in future projects using LLM.

## Main View

LangChain is an open-source development framework for LLM applications, offering packages in Python and Javascript. It consists of modular components, allowing us to combine various modules to achieve our use cases.
 

## Main Functions


1. **Models, Prompts, and Parsers**:
Models are all the LLMs available for use in the LangChain framework. We can utilize a variety of different models in our LangChain project.
Prompts are styled inputs for the models. LangChain provides some ready-to-use prompts in its documentation.
Parsers generate structured outputs from the model. These outputs can be modified to respond in the desired manner.
